       <p class="post-description"> I've just recently organized a workshop to popularize the Kotlin programming language. I like Kotlin a lot, but I cannot say I mastered it entirely, so this was quite a challenge for me. I like to push my boundaries a bit further every now and then and since presenting in front of group of people is not something that I do every day. I consider this to be the best proof that individual truly understands the topic. And also, knowing something does not necessarily mean one will be good at explaining it. So as this blog mainly serves as a vault for my acquired knowledge I've created a lessons learned list to avoid mistakes and on the other hand reuse patterns that were successful. </p>

       <p class="post-description"> Common approach on writing modern web applications is to have different technology stack for backend and frontend and let them communicate via RESTful web services. This decoupling, however, may introduce a security issue where attacker uses man-in-middle attack to eavesdrop on communication and inject malicious code. In other words cross-site request forgery. There are multiple ways how to implement protection against these kinds of attacks, like adding hidden input field with CSRF token to every form. But what if we don't generate forms on the server and are rather using stateless REST services? </p>
